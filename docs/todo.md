## Open Questions for Samee

## Omer & Anujan Alignment (Before Support Interviews)

- [ ] Write alignment doc for Omer & Anujan
  - **Mindset shift:** Support hires are about reducing escalations, not just fixing issues
  - **What to test for:** Pushback ability, systems thinking, pattern-fixing vs instance-fixing
  - **Red flags:** People who just want to debug, won't build runbooks, won't say no
  - **Interview questions:** What to ask, what good/bad answers look like
- [ ] Add requirement: They need to build monitoring/visibility for escalation funnel
  - Track full funnel from OPS (Tier 1) → Tier 2 → Tier 3
  - Not just "what gets past Tier 2" — need to see the whole picture
  - Metrics: volume at each tier, resolution rates, time to resolution, escalation reasons
  - This is prerequisite for measuring if new hires actually help
- [ ] Schedule 30-min alignment meeting to walk through doc
- [ ] Get their buy-in before they interview anyone

---

## After Samee Approval

- [ ] Finalize which hires proceed vs hold
- [ ] Define interview rubrics for each role
- [ ] Post external JDs
