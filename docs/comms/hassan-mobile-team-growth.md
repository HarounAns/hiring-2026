# Mobile Team Growth — Context for Hassan

Hey Hassan,

I wanted to loop you in on something exciting: **we're investing in mobile**.

## The Short Version

You shipped a real app. It's in the store. Customers use it. That's hard — most people never ship anything.

Because of what you built, we're now hiring a mobile engineer to help scale it. **This is validation, not replacement.** We're investing more in mobile because your work proved it's worth investing in.

## What This Means for You

- You stay on mobile
- You'll have someone to learn from and pair with
- You're the expert on how the app works — they'll need your help to ramp up
- Both of you will report to me — they're not your manager

**This is how teams grow.** You built the foundation. Now we're adding capacity to make it great.

## What I Need From You

Before we start interviewing, I want to understand what you built. Can we find 30 minutes this week to walk through:

1. **Where's the code?** I need access to the repo.

2. **How does it work?** Walk me through the architecture — what the app does, how it talks to our backend, which APIs it uses.

3. **Rork vs custom:** What did Rork generate vs what did you write/change?

4. **Dev setup:** How do I run it locally? Is there CI/CD? How do releases work?

5. **Pain points:** What's broken? What do customers complain about? What would you fix if you had more time?

6. **What do you want to learn?** What parts of mobile dev do you want to get better at? This helps me find someone who can help you grow.

## Your Role in Hiring

I want you involved in the interview process. When we talk to candidates, I'll ask for your input:

- "Would you want to work with this person?"
- "Do they seem like they'd respect what you built?"
- "Would you learn from them?"

Your opinion matters. This is your teammate.

## The Bottom Line

You shipped something real. We're doubling down on it. That's a good thing.

Let's find time to chat this week.
