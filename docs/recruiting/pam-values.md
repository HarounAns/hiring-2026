# Pam.ai Values

A startup is an expression of the founders' lived and stated values. What we say and how we work is how the company does things. At least until a point. As we scale it becomes harder to expect everyone to work in the same way. The share of founder time for each employee gets diluted. Furthermore, there may even be misalignment amongst founders. Therefore, it's important to document our values and socialize them amongst ourselves and the company. To have others act as we do and as we want is the highest leverage thing we can do. Values are how it's done.

To come to the initial list below I referenced our original company values slide show and reflected on what's got us here. 

Once we document this, we will see immediate gains from others in the company who aren't acted accordingly right now, and long term gains from alignment with candidates in the recruitment process.

## What Values Are Meant to Be

- Represent a tradeoff. They have to be a little edgy or else they're just meaningless platitudes.
- Define how we work
- Inform how we interact with one another
- Represent what got us here

## Pam's Core Values

### 1. Never Disappoint the Customer

We take a service-oriented approach: highly attentive and highly responsive to our dealers. We use automations, software, and AI to proactively identify opportunities, solve issues before they become problems, and drive their success. Prioritize driving real value and direct engagement with customers.

### 2. Owner's Mindset

Everyone gives their best effort, takes full responsibility for outcomes, and takes pride in their work. No passengers, every role matters.

### 3. Share the Truth When It Hurts

We share openly, surface blockers quickly, and do not hide problems.

- Communicate early and often
- Prefer in-person communication
- When in doubt, use Slack channels, not DMs
- Do not let yourself stay blocked, insist on guidance or clarification
- Do not let failure happen silently. It's okay to make mistakes and okay to fail. That's gonna happen as we push boundaries and move fast. What's important is that we learn from mistakes and failures and ensure it doesn't happen again.

### 4. Ship Fast With Urgency: Done is Better Than Perfect

We value momentum and iteration over slow perfectionism. We work with urgency to keep deals moving, customer issues solved, and projects unblocked.

Quality and quantity both matter. When in doubt, opt to do more than spend longer on a single thing.

### 5. Embrace AI

We leverage AI to move faster, scale smarter, and deliver better results than competitors. And we stay in the driver's seat. AI is a tool; you are responsible for your output and can't make it your crutch.

### 6. Protect the Zone

We safeguard our time, focus, and momentum by minimizing distractions and keeping the team aligned on the highest-impact priorities.

### 7. Ruthless Prioritization

We invest in what directly drives dealership adoption, retention, and growth. Distractions do not survive here.

### 8. Principles over Profit

When faced with a business proposition that challenges our principles and values, we preserve our principles and seek opportunity elsewhere.
