# Culture Fit Screen (Haroun)

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Interviewer:** Haroun  
**Applies to:** All roles — this is the first interview every candidate does with us.

---

## Philosophy

This is intentionally short and intentionally brutal. Candidates hear the unvarnished reality of the job — fast pace, high expectations, lots of ambiguity. This filters out people looking for a comfortable job. The people who stay after hearing the truth are the ones we want.

**We hire in this order: Culture → Aptitude → Skills.** This screen is the culture gate. If they don't pass here, nothing else matters.

## Structure

### 1. Learn About the Applicant

Get to know them. What are their goals? What are they looking for? Let them talk.

### 2. Why Pam?

Why do they want to work for Pam specifically? Are they excited about what we're building, or is this just another application?

### 3. Where Do You See Yourself in 10 Years?

**What you're listening for:** They should want to be a founder. Someone building something of their own. That ambition signals the kind of person who treats Pam like their own company — not a stepping stone, but a place to learn how to build.

**Follow-up: "In 5 years, how do you get there?"**

**What you're listening for:** They should see themselves leading things at Pam. Owning products, owning teams, driving outcomes. Not "I'll be a senior engineer at a bigger company." The 5-year answer should connect to the 10-year answer — Pam is where they build the muscle to eventually go do their own thing.

### 4. Tell Me About AI

How do they think about AI? How do they use it day-to-day? This isn't about technical depth — it's about whether they're leaning into the future or coasting on the past. We're an AI company. If they're not excited about AI and actively using it, they're already behind.

### 5. The "Worst Job Ever" Pitch + The Oath

How committed are they to working hard? This is where you tell them the reality:

- This is a startup. It's hard.
- Fast pace, high expectations, lots of ambiguity.
- You ship code Day 1. You own outcomes, not tasks.
- There's no hand-holding.

Then ask them to commit. Get them to say it out loud — that they will work harder than they ever have before. This is the oath.

**The oath is the gate.** Everything else in this interview gives you signal about who they are. The oath is the decision. If they take it, they advance to technical. If they hedge, the interview is over.

## What You're Filtering For

| Signal | What it looks like |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Wants the grind** | Hears "hard" and gets excited, not scared |
| **Ownership mentality** | Talks about outcomes they drove, not tasks they completed |
| **Ambition** | 10-year vision is founder-level; 5-year is leading at Pam |
| **AI-native** | Uses AI daily, has opinions about it, excited about where it's going |
| **Grit** | Has stories of pushing through hard things — not just talking about it |
| **Low ego** | Willing to do unglamorous work, doesn't need titles |

---

## Red Flags

- "I need to understand the full architecture before I can contribute"
- "That's not my job"
- Work-life balance as priority #1
- No opinion on AI or doesn't use it
- 10-year vision is "comfortable senior role at a big company"
- Gets quiet or hedges when they hear the reality of the job
- Can't explain things simply
- Needs constant direction

---

## Decision

Questions 1–4 give you signal. The oath is the decision.

**Takes the oath → advances to technical. Hedges → done.**

Everything else you learn in this screen (ambition, AI, why Pam) is useful context for later rounds, but the culture gate is the commitment to grind.
