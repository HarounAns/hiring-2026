# Culture Fit Screen (Haroun)

**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Interviewer:** Haroun  
**Applies to:** All roles — this is the first interview every candidate does with us.

## Philosophy

This is intentionally short and intentionally brutal. Candidates hear the unvarnished reality of the job — fast pace, high expectations, lots of ambiguity. This filters out people looking for a comfortable job. The people who stay after hearing the truth are the ones we want.

**We hire in this order: Culture → Aptitude → Skills.** This screen is the culture gate. If they don't pass here, nothing else matters.

## Structure

### 1. Learn About the Applicant

Get to know them. What are their goals? What are they looking for? Let them talk.

### 2. Why Pam?

Why do they want to work for Pam specifically? Are they excited about what we're building, or is this just another application?

### 3. Where Do You See Yourself in 10 Years?

**What you're listening for:** They should want to be a founder. Someone building something of their own. That ambition signals the kind of person who treats Pam like their own company — not a stepping stone, but a place to learn how to build.

**Follow-up: "In 5 years, how do you get there?"**

**What you're listening for:** They should see themselves leading things at Pam. Owning products, owning teams, driving outcomes. Not "I'll be a senior engineer at a bigger company." The 5-year answer should connect to the 10-year answer — Pam is where they build the muscle to eventually go do their own thing.

### 4. Tell Me About AI

How do they think about AI? How do they use it day-to-day? This isn't about technical depth — it's about whether they're leaning into the future or coasting on the past. We're an AI company. If they're not excited about AI and actively using it, they're already behind.

### 5. The "Worst Job Ever" Pitch

How committed are they to working hard? This is where you tell them the reality:

- This is a startup. It's hard.
- Fast pace, high expectations, lots of ambiguity.
- You ship code Day 1. You own outcomes, not tasks.
- There's no hand-holding.

**Watch their reaction.** The right people hear this and lean in. The wrong people get quiet or start hedging.

## What You're Filtering For

| Signal | What it looks like |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Wants the grind** | Hears "hard" and gets excited, not scared |
| **Ownership mentality** | Talks about outcomes they drove, not tasks they completed |
| **Ambition** | 10-year vision is founder-level; 5-year is leading at Pam |
| **AI-native** | Uses AI daily, has opinions about it, excited about where it's going |
| **Grit** | Has stories of pushing through hard things — not just talking about it |
| **Low ego** | Willing to do unglamorous work, doesn't need titles |

---

## Red Flags

- "I need to understand the full architecture before I can contribute"
- "That's not my job"
- Work-life balance as priority #1
- No opinion on AI or doesn't use it
- 10-year vision is "comfortable senior role at a big company"
- Gets quiet or hedges when they hear the reality of the job
- Can't explain things simply
- Needs constant direction

---

## Decision

This is a **Yes / No** gate. If you're not sure, it's a No.

**One No = No Hire.** If they don't pass culture, don't proceed to technical rounds.
