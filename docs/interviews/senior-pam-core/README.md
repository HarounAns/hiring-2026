## Interview Philosophy

**This is not a trick question. This is free consulting.**

We present a real problem (customer churn due to quality issues) and see how they think through it.

**We're testing:**
- How they structure problems
- Systems thinking (not just task completion)
- Production maturity (safety, measurement, rollback)
- Customer empathy
- Experience (bonus if they've done it, not required)

**Format:**
- Share a Google Doc with the candidate
- Paste the problem statement in the doc
- Let them write out their thinking in the doc
- Thread-pull based on what they write
- This tests written communication + async thinking (how we actually work)
