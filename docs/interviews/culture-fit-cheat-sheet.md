| 1 | **Tell me about yourself. What are your goals?** | Ambition, self-awareness, what drives them | "What matters most to you in your next role?" | Vague, no direction, just looking for any job |
| 2 | **Why Pam?** | Genuine excitement about what we're building | "What do you know about what we do?" | Generic answer that could apply to any company |
| 3 | **Where do you see yourself in 10 years?** | **Founder.** Wants to build their own thing. | ↓ | "Senior engineer at Google" / comfort-seeking |
| 4 | ↳ **In 5 years, how do you get there?** | **Leading at Pam.** Owning products, teams, outcomes. | "What would you need to learn to get there?" | No connection to the 10-year answer / passive |
| 5 | **Tell me about AI. How do you use it?** | Uses it daily, has opinions, leans into it | "What's something you built or did faster because of AI?" | Doesn't use it / no opinion / skeptic |
| 6 | **How committed are you to working hard?** | Leans in. Has done it before. Wants the grind. | Pitch the reality ↓ | Hedges, gets quiet, starts negotiating boundaries |

### The Pitch + The Oath (after Q6)

Tell them the reality:

> This is the hardest job you'll ever have. Fast pace, high expectations, lots of ambiguity. You ship code Day 1. You own outcomes, not tasks. There's no hand-holding.

Then ask them to commit. Get them to say it — out loud, on the call. That they will work harder than they ever have before.

**The oath is the gate.** If they take it, they advance to technical. If they hedge, it's over.

### Quick Decision

Questions 1–5 give you signal. The oath is the decision.

| | Signal | What you're learning |
|---|--------|---------------------|
| **10-year** | Founder → great. Comfort → concern. | Ambition level |
| **5-year** | Leading at Pam → great. Passive → concern. | Do they connect ambition to action? |
| **AI** | Uses it, excited → great. Doesn't use it → concern. | Are they leaning into the future? |
| **Why Pam** | Specific, genuine → great. Generic → concern. | Running toward us or away from something? |
| **The Oath** | **Takes it → advance. Hedges → done.** | **This is the decision.** |

**If they take the oath, they go to technical. If they don't, they're out.**
