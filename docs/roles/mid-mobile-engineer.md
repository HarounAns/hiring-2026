# Mid-Level Mobile Engineer

## Problem This Role Solves

**Problem:** We have a working mobile app built by a junior engineer, but it needs to be upleveled. The app works but doesn't look great. We need someone to professionalize our mobile presence.

**Current state:**
- Junior engineer built mobile app using Rork (https://rork.com/)
- App is live in the store and functional
- Skinny layer on top of existing backend — core functionality already exists
- Works but needs polish, better UX, and professional mobile engineering practices

**Why now:**
- App exists and works — foundation is there
- Need to improve quality before it becomes a liability
- Junior engineer needs guidance/mentorship on mobile
- Future mobile initiatives need proper mobile engineering foundation

---

## Role Summary

This is a **mobile engineering** role focused on upleveling Pam's mobile app. You'll inherit a working app, improve its quality, and establish mobile best practices for future development.

**What you're getting:**
- Working app in the store (built with Rork)
- Functional backend integration already exists
- Junior engineer who built it (potential mentee)

**What you'll do:**
- Improve app quality, UX, and polish
- Establish mobile engineering best practices
- Mentor junior engineer on mobile development
- Build foundation for future mobile initiatives

**Tech context:** App is a skinny layer on existing backend. Core APIs and functionality already built by Pam Core team.

- Teach mobile engineering fundamentals
- Code review and pair programming
- Help them grow as a mobile developer

### 4. Ship Improvements
- Code in production Day 1
- Iterative improvements based on user feedback
- Work with backend team when APIs need changes
- Own mobile releases end-to-end

### 5. Plan Future Mobile
- Assess current architecture and recommend improvements
- Identify what can be improved incrementally vs rebuilt
- Plan roadmap for mobile quality improvements
- Consider future mobile initiatives (new apps, features)

## Requirements

### Must Have
- 3-5 years mobile engineering experience
- **React Native + Expo experience** — this is what the app is built with (NOT native iOS/Android)
- Strong JavaScript/TypeScript — our stack is TypeScript
- Uses AI to code (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) — this is how we work
- Experience improving existing apps (not just greenfield)
- Can ship quickly — code in production Day 1
- Comfortable mentoring junior engineers

### Nice to Have
- iOS and Android native experience
- App store optimization experience
- Experience with low-code/no-code tools (Rork, Expo, etc.)
- B2B mobile app experience
- Experience upleveling junior-built codebases

### Mindset
- **Pragmatic** — improve what's there vs rewrite everything
- **Quality-focused** — cares about polish and UX details
- **Mentor mindset** — wants to help junior engineer grow
- **Ships fast** — iterative improvements, not big bang releases
- **Collaborative** — works well with backend team on API needs

---

## What They'll Work On (First 30 Days)

**Week 1:**
- Day 1: Get access, ship first improvement (bug fix or UI polish)
- Day 2-3: Deep dive on current app codebase, understand architecture
- Day 4-5: Meet with junior engineer, understand what they built and how
- End of week: First improvements live, documented assessment started

**Week 2:**
- Shipping improvements daily
- Document current state and quick wins
- Start establishing dev workflow (if missing CI/CD, testing, etc.)
- Identify biggest UX pain points

**Week 3-4:**
- Shipping features independently
- Written assessment of current state + recommendations
- Plan for months 2-3 that Haroun believes in
- Regular pairing sessions with junior engineer

---

## Reporting & Team

- **Reports to:** Haroun (CTO)
- **Works with:**
  - Junior engineer who built the app (mentee)
  - Pam Core team (for backend/API needs)
- **Stakeholders:** OPS/CS (user feedback), customers

---

## The Rork Context

The app was built using [Rork](https://rork.com/), an AI-powered mobile app builder that generates **React Native + Expo** code.

| Aspect | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Tech stack** | React Native + Expo (JavaScript/TypeScript) |
| **Codebase** | AI-generated React Native code, may need cleanup |
| **Architecture** | Likely straightforward, may need professionalization |
| **Backend** | Thin client — most logic in existing Pam Core APIs |
| **Opportunity** | Foundation exists, needs polish and best practices |

**Key implication:** You need someone who knows **React Native**, not native iOS (Swift) or Android (Kotlin).

**Your job is NOT to rewrite** — it's to improve incrementally while establishing practices for future work.

---

## Red Flags (Don't Hire If...)

- Wants to rewrite from scratch — this is about upleveling, not rebuilding
- Only knows native iOS or Android — needs cross-platform experience
- Can't work with junior-built code — needs patience and pragmatism
- Doesn't want to mentor — junior engineer relationship is key
- Needs greenfield projects — this is improving existing work
- Can't ship fast — we need iterative improvements, not big releases

---

## How to Test for "Uplevel vs Rewrite" Mindset

This is critical. Many senior engineers default to rewriting rather than improving. Test for this explicitly:

### Interview Questions

**1. Past experience with inherited code:**
> "Tell me about a time you inherited a codebase built by someone more junior. What was your approach?"

| Green Flag | Red Flag |
|------------|----------|
| "I shipped quick wins while learning the codebase" | "I convinced them we needed to rewrite it" |
| "I prioritized what affected users most" | "I refactored it to follow best practices" |
| "I introduced testing gradually" | "The foundation was wrong so we started over" |

**2. Present the actual situation:**
> "You'll inherit a mobile app built by a junior engineer using Rork. It's live in the store, works, but needs polish. Walk me through your first 30 days."

| Green Flag | Red Flag |
|------------|----------|
| "Day 1 I'd ship a small improvement" | "I'd do a full assessment first" |
| "I'd understand what's working before changing" | "I'd evaluate if we should rebuild" |
| "Quick wins build trust and momentum" | "We need to fix the architecture first" |

**3. Push on trade-offs:**
> "What if the code is really messy? When IS it right to rewrite?"

| Green Flag | Red Flag |
|------------|----------|
| "Almost never. Incremental > rewrite." | "If the foundation is wrong, faster to start over" |
| "Rewrites take forever and have new bugs" | "Technical debt compounds, better to fix early" |
| "Ship improvements while cleaning up" | "You can't build on a bad foundation" |

**4. Mentorship scenario:**
> "The junior's code works but doesn't follow best practices. How do you handle that?"

| Green Flag | Red Flag |
|------------|----------|
| "Prioritize — fix what affects users first" | "Refactor it to do it the right way" |
| "Teach through code review, not rewrites" | "Show them the proper patterns by rebuilding" |
| "Celebrate that it works, improve incrementally" | "They need to learn to do it correctly" |

### What You're Looking For

The right candidate:
- **Respects working software** — it's in the store, users use it, that's valuable
- **Ships first, cleans later** — momentum matters more than perfection
- **Pragmatic about "best practices"** — knows when they matter vs when they're dogma
- **Lifts others up** — sees junior's work as foundation to build on, not mistakes to fix
