# Senior Operations Engineer – AI-Powered Support Automation

## About the Role

Pam is the fastest-growing voice AI platform for auto dealerships. We handle millions of calls, book service appointments, and drive real revenue for 500+ dealerships. As we scale, our support process needs to scale with us — and we're not going to do it by throwing bodies at the problem.

We're hiring a Senior Operations Engineer to build AI-powered automation for our support process. You'll turn a manual, leaky email-based system into an intelligent pipeline with full observability. Your goal: make AI the first line of defense, so humans focus on the hard problems.

If you get energy from automation, love building internal tools, and want to see AI handle real customer issues — this is your role.

## What You'll Do

- **Build the Email → Ticket Pipeline:** Turn support emails into structured, routed tickets automatically using AI for classification and extraction
- **Create Observability:** Build dashboards that show support volume, resolution rates by tier, and escalation patterns — give us data we don't have today
- **Enable AI Tier 0:** Build a knowledge base and auto-response system where AI drafts answers, humans approve, and the system learns over time
- **Create AI-Enabled Runbooks:** Let ops query "what do I check for this issue?" and get actionable steps, then test the fix and auto-notify the customer
- **Smart Triage:** Build routing that suggests the right escalation path (PAM Core vs Integrations) and flags urgent issues
- **Optimize the Funnel:** Use data to identify automation opportunities, run experiments, and push more resolutions to AI and Tier 1

## You Might Be a Good Fit If You

- Have 3+ years of software engineering experience
- Are strong in TypeScript (our entire stack) and AWS
- Use AI to code — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or equivalent. This is how we work.
- Have built automation, pipelines, or internal tooling before
- Are comfortable integrating AI/LLMs into production systems
- Are data-obsessed — you measure everything and run experiments
- Ship fast — you'd rather have a working prototype than a perfect spec
- Care about the people using your tools — you'll work closely with ops, not build in isolation

## What Success Looks Like

**Month 1:**
- Code in production Week 1
- Email → ticket pipeline working (MVP)
- Basic funnel dashboard exists
- One quick win that saves ops time

**Month 3:**
- 90%+ of emails automatically become tickets
- AI handling 10%+ of requests without human intervention
- Escalations going to the right person 80%+ of the time

**Month 6:**
- AI handling 25%+ of requests (Tier 0)
- 30% faster time to resolution
- Knowledge base actively used by ops team
- Runbooks integrated into daily workflow

## Bonus Points

- Experience with support/ticketing systems (Zendesk, Intercom, Linear)
- Built knowledge base or FAQ automation before
- Experience with email parsing and processing
- Background in DevOps, SRE, or internal platform engineering
- You've automated yourself out of a job before (and loved it)
