# Senior Engineer – New Product (0→1)

## About the Role

Pam is the fastest-growing voice AI platform for auto dealerships. We handle millions of calls, book service appointments, and drive real revenue for 500+ dealerships. Now we're expanding into a new product line — and we need someone to own it.

We're hiring a Senior Engineer to take over an early-stage product from the CTO and make it their own. You'll inherit a working MVP, productionize it, and scale it. This is a 0→1 role — you'll own everything from prompt engineering to data modeling to full-stack feature development.

If you want to own a product, not just write code for someone else's vision — this is your role.

## What You'll Do

- **Own the Product:** Take over from the CTO as primary engineer. This becomes your product.
- **Productionize:** Turn a working MVP into a reliable, scalable, maintainable system. Handle edge cases, add observability, make it operable.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Own the AI behavior — build guardrails, tune conversations, improve over time
- **Data Modeling:** Understand and extend a complex orchestration system. Build new entities that fit into existing primitives.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Build dashboards, analytics, integrations, multi-channel features
- **Data Analysis:** Instrument for reporting, make decisions based on what the data shows

## You Might Be a Good Fit If You

- Have 4+ years of software engineering experience
- Are strong in TypeScript (our entire stack) and AWS
- Use AI to code — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or equivalent. This is how we work.
- Have strong prompt engineering skills — or are excited to develop them
- Can work with complex data models (ERDs, relational schemas, SQL)
- Are full-stack capable — backend, APIs, dashboards
- Thrive in ambiguity — you can take a PRD and turn it into working software
- Want to own a product, not just contribute to one

## What Success Looks Like

**Month 1:**
- Code in production Day 1
- Multiple PRs merged Week 1
- Handling bugs without the CTO by Week 2
- Can explain how the data model works

**Month 3:**
- Own the product day-to-day (CTO not involved)
- System is more reliable — fewer customer-reported issues
- Shipping new features independently

**Month 6:**
- Product scaling — building out the team (engineering, ops/cs) in a data-driven way
- Key differentiating features launched
- You're running the product, not just building it

## Bonus Points

- Experience with CRM integrations
- Built multi-channel messaging systems (SMS, email, voice)
- Worked on 0→1 products before
- Experience with outbound/marketing automation
- Automotive or dealership domain knowledge
