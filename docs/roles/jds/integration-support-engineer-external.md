# Support Engineer – Integrations (DMS & Data Sync)

## About the Role

Pam is the fastest-growing voice AI platform for auto dealerships. We handle millions of calls, book service appointments, and drive real revenue for 500+ dealerships. To do this, we integrate with every major Dealer Management System — Tekion, CDK, XTime, MyKaarma, Dealer-FX, and more.

We're hiring a Support Engineer to own integration issues. You'll debug why data didn't sync, fix it (code or config), and build systems so problems don't repeat. This isn't traditional support — you'll ship PRs, improve integration reliability, and build runbooks that make the whole team more effective.

If you like debugging APIs, tracing data flows, and owning problems end-to-end — this is your role.

## What You'll Do

- **Debug Integrations:** Trace API failures, webhook issues, and data sync problems across our DMS integrations
- **Diagnose Configuration Issues:** Use AWS tools (DynamoDB, S3) to audit settings and identify misconfigurations
- **Know Integration Limitations:** Distinguish what's custom work vs what's a limitation of a specific DMS (Tekion can do X, but CDK can't)
- **Ship Fixes:** Open PRs for bugs you find. Don't just diagnose — fix it, test it, deploy it
- **Work with Providers:** Navigate third-party documentation and coordinate on issues (Tekion, CDK, XTime, MyKaarma)
- **Build Runbooks:** Create documentation and tools so the ops team can handle more issues without escalating to you
- **Protect Your Time:** Push back when issues get escalated that shouldn't. Every repeat escalation is a failure — fix it permanently or build a runbook

## You Might Be a Good Fit If You

- Have 1-3 years of software engineering experience
- Are strong in TypeScript (our entire stack) and AWS
- Use AI to code — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or equivalent. This is how we work.
- Have experience with APIs and integrations — you can read API docs, debug requests/responses, trace data flow
- Have strong debugging skills — you can read logs, trace issues, and find root cause
- Can ship PRs — you don't just find problems, you fix them
- Write clearly — you'll communicate with customers and build documentation
- Are patient with third parties but protective of your own time

## What Success Looks Like

**Month 1:**
- Understand our top 5 integrations (Tekion, CDK, XTime, MyKaarma, Dealer-FX)
- Handling escalations with guidance
- Shipped your first fix
- Created your first runbook for the ops team

**Month 3:**
- Handling Tier 2 integration issues independently
- 10+ integration-related fixes shipped
- Ops team using your runbooks daily
- Fewer issues escalating to the integrations engineering team

**Month 6:**
- Resolving 80%+ of escalations without senior engineering help
- Ops team handling issues they used to escalate to you
- Integration reliability measurably improved

## Bonus Points

- Experience with CRM or DMS systems
- Experience with webhook architectures
- SQL skills for querying customer data
- Built internal tools or runbooks before
- You've worked with third-party API providers before
