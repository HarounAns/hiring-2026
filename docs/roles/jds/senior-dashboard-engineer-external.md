# Senior Full-Stack Engineer – Dashboard (TypeScript/Next.js/AWS)

## About the Role

Pam is the fastest-growing voice AI platform for auto dealerships. We handle millions of calls, book service appointments, and drive real revenue for 500+ dealerships. Our dashboard is how dealers interact with Pam — viewing conversations, managing settings, and seeing their ROI.

We're hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to own dashboard development. You'll build features that help dealers get value from Pam — things like conversation management, analytics, and operational tools. This is full-stack work: React/Next.js on the frontend, TypeScript APIs on the backend, all running on AWS.

If you want to ship features that customers use daily, not just internal tools — this is your role.

## What You'll Do

- **Ship Dashboard Features:** Build customer-facing features in the dealer dashboard — conversation views, analytics, settings, operational tools
- **Full-Stack Development:** Frontend (React/Next.js), backend (TypeScript APIs), and database work. Own features end-to-end.
- **Work Across Systems:** Coordinate with backend teams when features require data or capabilities from core systems
- **Customer Impact:** Build interfaces that dealers actually want to use. Think about UX and value visibility.
- **Ship Fast:** Code in production Day 1. We move quickly and iterate based on customer feedback.

## You Might Be a Good Fit If You

- Have 3+ years of software engineering experience
- Are strong in TypeScript (our entire stack) and React/Next.js
- Have AWS experience (we run on AWS)
- Use AI to code — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or equivalent. This is how we work.
- Are full-stack capable — comfortable with frontend, APIs, and databases
- Care about UX — you build things that work AND are easy to use
- Ship fast — you can have code in production your first day
- Are pragmatic — you build what's needed, not over-engineered solutions

## What Success Looks Like

**Month 1:**
- Code in production Day 1
- Multiple PRs merged Week 1
- Shipped at least one customer-facing improvement
- Understands dashboard architecture and data flow

**Month 3:**
- Shipping features independently, multiple per sprint
- Customer-requested features making it to production
- Contributing to architecture discussions

**Month 6:**
- Owning major dashboard initiatives end-to-end
- Dashboard quality measurably improved
- Features helping close deals (mentioned in win analysis)

## Bonus Points

- Experience with dashboards, admin panels, or B2B SaaS interfaces
- Data visualization experience (charts, analytics)
- Experience with real-time features (WebSockets, live updates)
- SQL proficiency for analytics features
- Eye for UX without needing a designer
