# Mobile Engineer (React Native)

## About the Role

Pam is the fastest-growing voice AI platform for auto dealerships. We handle millions of calls, book service appointments, and drive real revenue for 500+ dealerships. We recently launched a mobile app for dealers, and we need someone to take it to the next level.

We're hiring a Mobile Engineer to uplevel our existing mobile app. You'll inherit a working app that's live in the store, improve its quality and UX, and establish mobile best practices for future development. This isn't a greenfield role — it's about making something good into something great.

If you like improving existing products, care about polish and UX, and want to mentor a junior engineer along the way — this is your role.

## What You'll Do

- **Uplevel the App:** Improve UX, polish, and quality of our existing mobile app
- **Establish Best Practices:** Set up proper mobile development workflow, testing, and CI/CD
- **Mentor:** Work with the junior engineer who built the app, help them grow
- **Ship Fast:** Code in production Day 1. Iterative improvements, not big bang releases.
- **Plan Future:** Assess architecture and recommend improvements for future mobile work

## You Might Be a Good Fit If You

- Have 3-5 years of mobile engineering experience
- Have **React Native + Expo experience** — this is our stack (not native iOS/Android)
- Are strong in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use AI to code — Rork, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or equivalent. This is how we work.
- Have experience improving existing apps (not just greenfield)
- Care about UX polish and quality details
- Are comfortable mentoring junior engineers
- Can ship fast — code in production your first day

## What Success Looks Like

**Month 1:**
- Code in production Day 1
- First improvements live Week 1
- Documented assessment of current app state
- Working relationship with junior engineer

**Month 3:**
- App quality noticeably improved
- Mobile CI/CD and testing in place
- Junior engineer shipping better code
- Clear roadmap for future improvements

**Month 6:**
- Improved app store ratings/reviews
- Solid mobile architecture for future work
- Junior can handle mobile work independently
- Mobile app not a customer complaint

## Bonus Points

- iOS and Android native experience
- App store optimization experience
- Experience with low-code tools (Expo, Rork, etc.)
- B2B mobile app experience
- Experience upleveling codebases built by junior engineers
