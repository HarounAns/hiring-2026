# Pam Core Support Engineer (x2)

## Problem This Role Solves

**Problem #1:** Customers don't onboard fast enough → delayed revenue, bad first impression.

**Problem #2:** No visibility into customer health → reactive firefighting instead of proactive support.

**Root Cause:** Support load falls on engineers who should be building. No dedicated support function for technical issues.

**Why now:** We're signing 30-40 dealers/month but can't activate them fast enough. This is THE growth bottleneck.

## Role Summary

You'll be the front line for customer technical issues, owning the onboarding experience and building visibility into customer health. This is a technical support role, not a customer service role—you'll debug real issues, not read scripts.

---

## Responsibilities

- Handle tier-1 technical support (escalate complex issues to engineering)
- Own customer onboarding from technical handoff to go-live
- Build and maintain customer health dashboards
- Document common issues and create runbooks
- Identify patterns in support tickets → feed back to product/eng
- Proactively monitor customer health and intervene before issues escalate

---

## Success Criteria

|--------|--------|----------------|
| Ramp | Handling tier-1 support independently | Manager assessment |
| Onboarding time | -20% from baseline | Time from contract to go-live |

| Shadow | Completed shadowing with Maheen | Checklist |

### 6 Months

## Requirements

### Must Have
- 1-3 years technical support or junior engineering experience
- Strong debugging skills (can read logs, trace issues)
- Excellent written and verbal communication
- Customer empathy (genuinely wants to help)
- Fast learner (can ramp on new systems quickly)

### Nice to Have
- Experience with voice/telephony systems
- Experience with CRM or dealership software
- SQL for querying customer data
- Experience building dashboards (Metabase, Looker, etc.)

### Mindset
- Patient with customers, impatient with broken processes

- Documents everything (future self and teammates will thank you)
- Takes ownership of issues until resolved

## What They'll Work On (First 90 Days)

1. **Week 1-2:** Onboard, shadow Maheen, understand product
2. **Week 3-4:** Handle supervised tickets, learn common issues
3. **Month 2:** Handle tickets independently, start documenting patterns
4. **Month 3:** Own onboarding for new customers, build first dashboard

---

## Reporting & Team

- **Reports to:** Haroun (CTO) initially, may move under Ops
- **Works with:** Maheen (Support), Waqar (Ops), Zach/Ashley (CS)
- **Mentorship from:** Senior Core hire (reliability practices)

---

## Why Two Hires?

- Current support load is unsustainable for Maheen alone
- Need coverage for different timezones/hours
- Redundancy (vacation, sick days)
- Can specialize (one on onboarding, one on monitoring)

---

## Compensation

*[To be filled based on market data]*

- Level: Junior (L2-L3 equivalent)
- Location: [Remote / Hybrid / On-site]

---

## Interview Process

See [interviews/support-engineer.md](../interviews/support-engineer.md)

---

## Red Flags (Don't Hire If...)

- Sees support as "beneath" engineering
- Poor communication skills
- Can't explain their debugging process
- No customer empathy (blames users)
- Wants to skip to "real engineering" immediately

---

## Alternative Considered

**1 mid-level instead of 2 juniors**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Faster ramp | More expensive |
| Less management overhead | Single point of failure |
| Can handle complex issues sooner | Less coverage |

**Decision:** Proceeding with 2 juniors for coverage, but open to 1 mid if candidate pool is weak.
