# Mid-Level Mobile Engineer

## ⚠️ STATUS: BELOW THE FOLD - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Before finalizing this JD, need answers from Samee:**

1. What is the mobile product priority for Q1?
2. Is mobile driving revenue or strategic positioning?
3. Why now vs Q2?
4. What would this person build in their first 90 days?

## Problem This Role Solves (UNKNOWN)

Currently unclear what problem this hire addresses.

**Possible reasons:**
- Mobile app is part of the product offering and needs investment
- Hassan (Junior Mobile) needs support
- Mobile is strategic for a new product line
- Customer requests for mobile features

---

- **Hassan** - Junior Engineer, Mobile

Adding a mid-level would give Hassan a senior partner.

- Can work independently with minimal supervision

## Questions to Resolve

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| What's the mobile strategy? | | |
| iOS, Android, or both? | | |
| Q1 mobile roadmap? | | |
| Why now vs Q2? | | |
| Is mobile tied to a new product? | | |

---

## Alternative: Defer to Q2

**If mobile is not a Q1 priority**, this hire could wait until:
- Core product is stable
- Mobile strategy is defined
- We understand if mobile is part of new product lines

**Risk of deferring:** Hassan is alone on mobile. If mobile IS a priority, he may be blocked or overloaded.
