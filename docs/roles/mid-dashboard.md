# Mid-Level Dashboard Engineer

## ⚠️ STATUS: BELOW THE FOLD - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Before finalizing this JD, need answers from Samee:**

1. Is the dashboard causing churn or blocking deals?
2. What would this person build in Q1?
3. Is dashboard part of the "doesn't feel good during eval" problem?
4. What's the Q1 roadmap for dashboard?

---

## Problem This Role Solves (HYPOTHESIZED)

**IF dashboard is part of bad eval experience:**
- Customers can't see value during trial
- Dashboard is confusing or lacks key metrics
- Time-to-value is too slow because dashboard doesn't show wins

**IF dashboard is a growth bottleneck:**
- Can't ship dashboard features fast enough
- Marcelo and Agustin are at capacity
- Dashboard requests are piling up

---

## Current Team

- **Marcelo** - Senior Engineer, Dashboard/FDE
- **Agustin** - Engineer, Dashboard (Junior)

Adding a mid-level would give the team a 3rd engineer.
