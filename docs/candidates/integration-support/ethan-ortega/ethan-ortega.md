# Candidate: Ethan Ortega

**Position:** Integration Support Engineer  
**LinkedIn:** *(Ethan O. — 3rd degree connection)*  
**Current Role:** Software Engineer at STELLA Automotive AI (competitor)  
**Location:** Riverside, CA (remote)

## Background

Currently at STELLA Automotive AI — the incumbent in our space. Started as an engineering intern (2023), moved to BDR (sales/business development), then back to software engineer (March 2025–present). Has seen STELLA from multiple angles: engineering, sales, customer success.

**At STELLA:**
- Handles integration issues and production fires
- Built internal tools across customer success, QA, backend systems
- Exposed to full business operations (sales, CS, engineering)

**Side projects:**
- Built voice AI solutions for local businesses (chiropractor office, weight loss clinic)
- Used existing APIs and retail solutions

**Education:** UC Riverside, Computer Science (2022–2024). Previously Riverside City College (Associate's, 2020–2022). Undergraduate research fellow — built ML model for FAA flight narrative classification.

## Internal Notes

> **Do not share the oath with Murshed.** The oath is an internal decision mechanism for Haroun's culture screen. Murshed gets a summary of why the candidate advanced, not the specific gate that cleared them.

## Why He's Interesting

- Works at the competitor. Knows the automotive AI space from the inside.
- Has integration + production fire experience — directly relevant to Integration Support.
- Cross-functional exposure (engineering, sales, CS) means he understands the full customer lifecycle.
- Building voice AI side projects on his own time shows initiative.

## Why There's Concern

- Junior. ~1 year as a software engineer. Resume initially looked too thin.
- 10-year vision needed coaching — initially said "systems engineer," adjusted to robotics founder after prompting.
- Untested at Pam's pace. STELLA felt "comfortable" to him — but comfortable at STELLA ≠ ready for Pam.

## Culture Fit Screen — Notes (Haroun, Feb 11 2026)

**Vote:** Pass (took the oath)

### What Happened

| Question | What he said | Signal |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Goals** | Wants to grow from integration-level to systems-level engineering | Skills-focused, but has direction |
| **Why Pam** | Stella feels comfortable, no growth fire. Wants faster pace, smarter people around him | Running toward Pam, not just away from Stella |
| **10 years** | Initially: "systems engineer." After coaching: robotics company, interested in AI since age 15 | Had to be led to founder answer — yellow flag |
| **5 years** | Needs business understanding and end-to-end technical skills | Didn't explicitly say "leading at Pam" |
| **AI** | Interested since 15, built voice AI side projects for local businesses | Genuine interest, not just buzzwords |
| **The Oath** | **Took it.** Made formal commitment to work harder than ever before. | ✅ Advances to technical. |

### Concerns Raised During Interview

- Initially appeared too junior based on resume
- 10-year vision seemed limited before coaching
- Haroun emphasized Pam seeks future founders — candidate adjusted after hearing this

### What to Watch in Technical Round

- Can he actually debug integration issues independently? (Not just "handle production fires" — can he trace through API failures, webhook issues, third-party delays?)
- How deep is his STELLA integration knowledge? Does he understand the DMS landscape?
- Pushback ability — can he say no to scope creep, or does he just take on everything?
- Is he junior-who-ships-fast, or junior-who-needs-hand-holding?

## For Omer (Technical Interview)

Ethan comes from STELLA, so he has automotive AI context that most candidates won't. Use that — but don't let it substitute for actual debugging ability.

**Test for:**
1. **API debugging** — Give him a real integration failure scenario (e.g., CDK webhook not firing, appointment data mismatch). See how he traces through it.
2. **Pushback ability** — "A dealer is escalating and wants you to drop everything. You're in the middle of debugging a different critical issue. What do you do?"
3. **Systems thinking** — Does he fix the instance or fix the pattern? If he finds a bug, does he also ask "why did this get through?"
4. **STELLA intel (bonus)** — What integrations does STELLA support? How do they handle integration failures? What's broken there that we could do better?

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Surface-level debugging ("I'd check the logs" without going deeper)
- Can't explain STELLA's integration architecture despite working there
- Takes on everything without prioritizing
- Needs to be told what to do next
