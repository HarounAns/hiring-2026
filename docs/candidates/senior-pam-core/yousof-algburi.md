## Interview Notes

### In "Solve Our Problem" Interview, Probe:

- "You've done this at CallBox. What worked? What didn't?"
- "What would you do differently with the benefit of hindsight?"
- "How did you handle reliability when you were solo vs with a team?"

### Watch For:

- Can he level up from "solo builder" to "team leader"?
- Does he have strong opinions from experience, or did he just ship and hope?
- Is he curious about how Pam does it, or does he think he already knows everything?
