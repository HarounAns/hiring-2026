## Interview Notes

### Yousof-Specific Probes

Use these **after** he gives his main answer to the "Solve Our Problem" question:

**Probe 1: What actually happened?**
> "You've done this at CallBox. When you hit this exact problem—customers churning because it didn't feel good—what did you actually do?"

**Listen for:**
- ✅ Admits he hit this problem (honesty)
- ✅ Walks through what he tried
- ✅ Mentions what worked AND what didn't
- ❌ Overconfident ("we solved it perfectly")
- ❌ Vague ("we iterated on quality")

---

**Probe 2: What would you do differently?**
> "With the benefit of hindsight, what would you do differently if you were starting over?"

**Listen for:**
- ✅ Has learned from mistakes
- ✅ Specific on what he'd change
- ✅ Humility
- ❌ "I wouldn't change anything"
- ❌ Can't articulate lessons learned

---

**Probe 3: Solo to team**
> "At CallBox you were solo. At Pam you'd have 3-4 engineers working with you. How would your approach change?"

**Listen for:**
- ✅ Thinks about delegation, ownership, communication
- ✅ Understands he needs to unblock others, not just code
- ✅ Excited about team leverage
- ❌ "I'd just keep doing what I did"
- ❌ Doesn't see the difference

---

**Probe 4: Scale**
> "You're at 110 dealerships. Pam is aiming for thousands. What breaks at that scale that works at 110?"

**Listen for:**
- ✅ Manual processes break
- ✅ Need automation, better instrumentation
- ✅ Can't rely on knowing every customer personally
- ❌ "Nothing breaks, just scales linearly"
- ❌ Doesn't see the difference

---

**Probe 5: Curiosity check**
> "How does Pam handle this right now?"

**Listen for:**
- ✅ Asks you how Pam does it
- ✅ Curious about your approach
- ✅ Wants to learn
- ❌ Doesn't ask
- ❌ Tells you what you should do

---

### Watch For:

**Green Flags:**
- Humility about what didn't work at CallBox
- Can articulate lessons learned
- Excited about scaling from solo to team
- Curious about how Pam approaches it
- Treats this as a learning opportunity, not just showing off

**Red Flags:**
- Overconfident ("I already solved this")
- Dismissive of Pam's current approach
- Can't admit what didn't work
- Thinks solo approach scales 1:1 to team
- Know-it-all attitude
